# Reflection

1. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I ran into a bunch of issues with this code, but succeeded in other places where I didn't think I would, so that part is positive. Some of the issues were simple things like the icon wouldn't work for some reason, but then I looked it up and found that I just had to restart my android emulator. I also ran into major issues with the toggle button. I got it to work for one, but couldn't figure out how to make the toggles individually and dynamically. I am hoping to learn how to fix this in class, and how to incorporate the arrays into it.

2. What new concepts or techniques did you learn during development?

I learned how to add the icons in class, and then found how to the toggle through react. I obviously didn't fully learn how to do it, but adding it in is a step so I am happy with that little bit of progress.

3. What improvements would you make if given more time?

If given more time, I would definitely do more improvements like styling issues (I would want the boxes to take up the full page and be scrollable, the items to have white borders around them, etc), as well as functionality improvements like making all the options have toggles.
